# Doom Speed Demo Archive

The Doom Speed Demo Archive hosts speed demos recorded for doom engine games,
including the original works by id, related projects such as heretic, and custom
content created by the community.
DSDA is currently hosted at doomedsda.us by Andy Olivera, who, along with
Opulent, has served the doom demo community for well over a decade.
The archive currently stores over 42k demos, with 3.5k hours of content.

The goal of this project is to create a new dsda, from scratch, implementing
a variety of features and improvements, such as support for additional
categories, heretic / hexen demos, zandronum demos, and extra stats / options.

Uses `Ruby  2.4` and `Rails 5.0`
